<b> Lab | <b> Digital Signal Processing Lab
<b> Experiment|     <b> 1. Write a Program for the generation of basic signals such as unit impulse, unit step, ramp, exponential, sinusoidal and cosine.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

In this lab the user learn the various MATLAB commands related to digital signal processing. The user can write the MATLAB code for generation of various signals and they can perform various operations on the signals in time domain and in frequency domain to observe the effect of operations and to understand the underlying concepts.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

In this experiment we will write a MATLAB code to generate the various basic signal such as unit impulse, unit step, ramp, exponential, sinusoidal and cosine signals. The user will select the signal from drop down menu and according to selected signal they can enter various parameters. In case of unit impulse and unit step signals, user can enter the delay parameter to observe the time shifting property of signals. Similarly, in case of ramp signal user can give the slope of the ramp as input parameter. For exponential signal user can enter the rate of exponential decay/increase and observe the waveforms. In case of sinusoidal signals various attributes such as amplitude, frequency and phase can be entered and effect can be observed on plotted waveforms. 

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

This experiment is useful for the students as well as the faculties who are involved in teaching-learning process of the course in Digital Signal Processing.

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>
